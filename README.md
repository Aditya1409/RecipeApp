# **RecipeApp**

This android-based RecipeApp is a mobile application designed to provide users with access to a vast collection of recipes using the Spoonacular API. The app aims to offer a seamless experience for discovering, exploring, and saving recipes.

### <ins>API Integration</ins>
The RecipeApp leverages the Spoonacular API, following the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) to interact with a rich database of recipes. REST,  a standard architectural style for web services, emphasizes a stateless client-server communication model using HTTP methods.

### <ins>Retrofit Implementation</ins>
Retrofit, a powerful HTTP client library for Android, was instrumental in integrating RESTful API endpoints into the app. Through retrofitâ€™s capabilities, the app achieved seamless integration with Spoonacular API, ensuring efficient communication and data retrieval.

### <ins>Data Parsing</ins>
Gson, a JSON library for Java, was utilized to parse JSON responses from the Spoonacular API.

### <ins>Image Handling</ins>
Picasso, a powerful image loading library, was integrated to fetch and display recipe images efficiently within the app. 

### <ins>Testing and Debugging</ins>
During development, Postman was key in testing API endpoints and verifying responses before integrating them into the app. It ensured reliability + accuracy of data fetched from the Spoonacular API.
